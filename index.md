# Welcome

### Do you:

###   - Need a break from too much scrolling?
###   - Feel burned-out by screen time?
###   - Wish you spent more time away from screens?

Maintaining healthy habits is hard work. Yet there’s something about screen time boundaries that often feels especially hard. Fortunately, there’s growing evidence for how using behavior change strategies helps people with all sorts of challenging habits. 

## In this [free PDF guide](doc.pdf) you’ll find:

   - An overview of why it’s important to set boundaries on your screen time.
   - Four big reasons limiting screen time is difficult.
   - How behavior change strategies can help your screen time habits.
   - A workbook to put into action changes you’d like to make.

### About the author and this project

I’m a health coach certified by the National Board for Health & Wellness Coaching (NBC-HWC). I also love to write. In my time working with clients, I’ve seen how much digital wellbeing ties into a person’s overall health and wellness. When I enrolled in the 2021 Duke Continuing Studies Technical Writing professional certificate to further my writing skills, I decided to create this free resource for folks to learn from and explore. 

I hope you enjoy and find value from the guide!
