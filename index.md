# Hey there,

## Do you:

   - Need a break from too much scrolling?
   - Feel burnt out by screen time?
   - Wish you spent more time away from screens?

Maintaining healthy habits is hard work. Yet often there’s something about screen time boundaries that feels especially hard. Fortunately, there’s a lot of evidence these days for how behavior change strategies can help people make these kinds of healthy changes in their lives. 

## In this [free PDF guide](doc.pdf) you’ll find:

   - An overview of why it’s important to set boundaries on your screen time.
   - Four big reasons limiting screen time is difficult.
   - How behavior change strategies can help your screen time habits.
   - A workbook to put into action changes you’d like to make.

### More about the author and the project

I’m a health coach certified by the National Board for Health & Wellness Coaching (NBC-HWC). I also love to write. In my time working with clients, I’ve seen how much digital wellbeing ties into a person’s overall health and wellness. I enrolled in the 2021 Duke Continuing Studies Technical Writing professional certificate to further my writing skills and decided for the final project to create this free resource for folks to learn from and explore. I hope you enjoy!
